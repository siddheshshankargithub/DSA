# DSA(Data Structures and Algorithm):

## ALGORITHM:
### What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions in sequence to solve a problem.

### Features of a Good Algo?
1. Input and output should be defined.
2. Each step in an algo should be clear and unambigous.
3. Algos should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
4. Algos shouldn't include computer code.

### Algorithm Examples:
#### 1] Algorithm to find the largest among three numbers:
1. Start
2. Declare variables a,b and c.
3. Read the variables a,b and c.
4. If a>b
          If a>c
            Display a is the largest number.
          If b>c
            Display b is the largest number.
          Else
            Display c is the greatest number.
5. Stop

#### 2] Algorithm for fibonacci series till <=1000:
1. Start 
2. Declare variables first_term,second_term and temp. 
3. Initialize variables first_term ← 0 second_term ← 1 
4. Display first_term and second_term 
5. Repeat the steps until second_term ≤ 1000 
     5.1. temp ← second_term 
     5.2. second_term ← second_term + first_term 
     5.3. first_term ← temp 
     5.4. Display second_term 
6. Stop
